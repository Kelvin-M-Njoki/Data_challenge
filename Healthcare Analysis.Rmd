## Unlocking Data Driven Solutions for Healthcare Accessibility

## A Case Study Nairobi County

```{r}
# importing the libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

```{r}
# importing the dataset
data_set_1<- read_excel("C:/Users/user pc/Desktop/ALX Datathon/ehealth_1kenya_facilities.xlsx")
View(data_set_1)

```

### Data Wrangling, Cleaning and EDA

The case study is specifically for Nairobi so we can reduce the granularity of the data set to only Nairobi county

```{r}
# creating a dataset for Nairobi
nairobi_df<- data_set_1%>%
  filter(tolower(County)=="nairobi")
view(nairobi_df)

```

Dropping the Province and the county columns since the dataset contains data pertaining Nairobi

```{r}

nairobi_df<- nairobi_df%>%
  select(-Province,-County)
view(nairobi_df)
# obtaining size of the dataset
dim(nairobi_df)
```

The dataset has 942 rows and 48 columns

```{r}
# analysing the attributes
colnames(nairobi_df)
# dropping columns with null values only
nairobi_clean<- nairobi_df%>%
  select(where(~ !all(is.na(.))))
view(nairobi_clean)

```

```{r}
# dropping missing entries.We need to get rid of the last 5 columns before getting dropping the missing values
nairobi_clean<- nairobi_clean%>%
  select(-tail(colnames(nairobi_clean),5))
view(nairobi_clean)
```

The dataframe still has a lot of columns with missing values

```{r}
# selecting columns that are not relevant to our study
colnames(nairobi_clean)
columns_to_drop<- nairobi_clean[,14:23]
view(columns_to_drop)
# dropping the columns
nairobi_clean<- nairobi_clean%>%
  select(-(colnames(columns_to_drop)))
view(nairobi_clean)
```

Notice that the bed column has hospitals with 0 beds, we can assume that these hospitals have no in- patient services and that those that have values greater than 1 offer both in-patient and outpatient services.

```{r}

# dropping our missing values
nairobi_clean<- drop_na(nairobi_clean)
dim(nairobi_clean)
```

We now have 524 entries with 16 columns. We can thus use this as a representative sample for healthcare in Nairobi county. Let's set the granularity of our data set to the constituency level.

Fact Check✔️: Nairobi has 17 constituencies, let's check that from our dataset

```{r}
constituencies<-unique(nairobi_clean$Constituency)
print(length(constituencies))
```

**😃Our dataset does have 17 constituencieswe can then further make our dataset easy to work with by using constituency as our location identifier**

```{r}
locations_to_drop<-nairobi_clean[,c(3,4,7,8,9,11)]
# dropping all other location identifiers
constituency_data<- nairobi_clean%>%
  select(-colnames(locations_to_drop))
view(constituency_data)
dim(constituency_data) # has 524 entries
```

```{r}
# checking for duplicate records using the unique identifier
cleaned_data<- constituency_data%>%
  distinct()
dim(cleaned_data) # has the same dimensions as the constituency dataset hence no duplicate records.
```

#### Constituency Analysis

We can group our new dataframe by the constituency column and summarise

```{r}
nairobi_grouped<- constituency_data%>%
  group_by(Constituency)%>%
  summarise(
    healthcare_facilities=n(), # the number of healthcare facilities per constituency
    total_beds= sum(Beds), # the total number of beds per constituency
    total_cots = sum(Cots) # total number of cots per constituency
  )
View(nairobi_grouped)
```

Quick Insight💡:

![](Hospital Summary.jpg)

-    Starehe constituency has the highest number of healthcare facilities while Mathare constituency has the smallest number of healthcare facilities

-   Lang'ata Constituency has the highest number of beds while Embakasi North has the smallest number of beds

-   Kamukunji has the most cots while LANG'ATA,DAGORETTI NORTH,MATHARE,DAGORETTI SOUTH all have 0 cots, this is highly unlikely. We'd need to go check into this🤔

```{r}
